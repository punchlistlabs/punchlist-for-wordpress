This plugin will allow you to share your posts and pages (including drafts!) for collaboration on Punchlist.

== Description ==

This plugin is a companion to the Punchlist application. It allows you to create new projects and/or add new pages to existing projects without leaving the WordPress admin dashboard. 
It even creates draft previews that are hidden from the public but available via Punchlist, allowing you to collaborate with clients and peers without the need for issuing user accounts.
You will need a Punchlist account which is free forever. There is no limit to the number of projects that can be created.

We are always looking for ways to improve, so please send us any feedback, bug reports or feature requests.
